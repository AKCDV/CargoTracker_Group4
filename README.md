The project aims to develop an IoT-based application for real-time humidity monitoring and control inside cargo trucks, ensuring optimal conditions for sensitive goods. 
It provides instant notifications to drivers if humidity levels deviate from preset thresholds, with options for automated adjustments via HVAC systems. 
Historical data is logged for compliance and reporting, while predictive analytics help prevent issues. Cloud integration allows fleet-wide monitoring for logistics managers.
------------------
-Real-Time Humidity Monitoring : Continuous tracking of humidity levels inside the cargo area using IoT sensors.

-Customizable Humidity Thresholds: Set specific humidity ranges based on the type of cargo being transported.

-Driver Alerts: Instant notifications via SMS, email, or mobile app if humidity levels fall outside the acceptable range.

-Automated Humidity Control: Integration with HVAC systems for automated adjustments to maintain ideal humidity levels.

-Data Logging & Reporting: Historical data storage and reporting for traceability and compliance with industry standards.

-Predictive Analytics: Machine learning to detect patterns and predict potential issues before they arise.

-Cloud Integration: Centralized monitoring for fleet managers to oversee multiple trucks remotely.

# User Stories:

As a driver, I want to receive real-time alerts on my mobile device when humidity levels inside the cargo area exceed safe limits, so I can take immediate action to protect the cargo.

As a fleet manager, I want to monitor the humidity levels of all trucks remotely from a centralized dashboard, so I can ensure product safety across the fleet.

As a logistics coordinator, I want to set specific humidity thresholds for different types of cargo, so that the system can maintain optimal conditions based on the product being transported.

As a truck owner, I want to view historical humidity data for each trip, so I can verify that goods were kept in proper conditions and provide proof to clients.

As a maintenance technician, I want the system to notify me of recurring humidity issues, so I can perform preventive maintenance on the truck's climate control systems.
