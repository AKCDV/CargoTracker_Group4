# Group4 IoT: Real-Time Humidity Monitoring for Cargo Trucks

## Project Overview
This project ensures the safe transport of sensitive goods by developing an IoT-based application that monitors and controls humidity inside cargo trucks. It sends instant alerts to drivers if conditions exceed set limits and can automatically adjust for the safest transportain of the cargos.

## Features

- **Real-Time Humidity Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of humidity levels inside the cargo area using IoT sensors.
- **Data Logging and Reporting**: Storage of historical data 
- **Cloud Integration**: Centralized fleet monitoring for logistics managers, enabling remote access to truck data.

## User Stories

Driver:

As a driver, I want to monitor real-time humidity levels on a mobile app so that I can stay informed about the cargo environment during transportation.

Fleet Manager:

As a fleet manager, I want to remotely access real-time and historical humidity data through a centralized cloud dashboard so that I can ensure the safe transport of 
goods across the fleet.

Logistics Coordinator:

As a logistics coordinator, I want to configure specific humidity thresholds for different cargo types through the system so that I can maintain optimal conditions tailored to the goods being transported.

Truck Owner:

As a truck owner, I want to view detailed logs and reports of humidity levels for each trip so that I can ensure compliance with client requirements and improve service 
reliability.

Maintenance Technician:

As a maintenance technician, I want access to historical data showing recurring humidity issues in specific trucks so that I can identify and resolve potential equipment problems proactively.

System Administrator:

As a system administrator, I want to ensure seamless integration between IoT sensors, the cloud platform, and the monitoring system so that the data flows accurately and efficiently.

## How to Use
1. Install IoT sensors in the cargo area.
2. Configure the system with customized humidity thresholds.
3. Integrate with systems for automated control.
4. Monitor data and receive alerts by text on phone

## Requirements
- IoT sensors (e.g., DHT11 or equivalent)
- Cloud platform ( Azure etc.)
- Internet connection for real-time data synchronization
