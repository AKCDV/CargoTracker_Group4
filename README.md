# Group4 IoT: Real-Time Humidity Monitoring for Cargo Trucks

## Project Overview
This project ensures the safe transport of sensitive goods by developing an IoT-based application that monitors and controls humidity inside cargo trucks. It sends instant alerts to drivers if conditions exceed set limits and can automatically adjust via HVAC systems to maintain safe conditions. Historical data is logged for compliance and traceability, and predictive analytics help avoid future problems. Cloud integration allows fleet managers to monitor multiple trucks remotely.

## Features

- **Real-Time Humidity Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of humidity levels inside the cargo area using IoT sensors.
- **Driver Alerts**: Notifications
- **Data Logging and Reporting**: Storage of historical data 
- **Cloud Integration**: Centralized fleet monitoring for logistics managers, enabling remote access to truck data.

## User Stories

- **Driver**: Receive real-time alerts on mobile devices when humidity levels exceed safe limits to take immediate action.
- **Fleet Manager**: Monitor humidity levels of all trucks remotely from a centralized dashboard to ensure product safety.
- **Logistics Coordinator**: Set specific humidity thresholds for different cargo types to maintain optimal conditions.
- **Truck Owner**: View historical humidity data for each trip to verify proper conditions and provide proof to clients.
- **Maintenance Technician**: Get notified of recurring humidity issues to perform preventive maintenance on HVAC systems.

## How to Use
1. Install IoT sensors in the cargo area.
2. Configure the system with customized humidity thresholds.
3. Integrate with systems for automated control.
4. Monitor data and receive alerts through the cloud dashboard.

## Requirements
- IoT sensors (e.g., DHT11 or equivalent)
- Cloud platform ( Azure etc.)
- Internet connection for real-time data synchronization
