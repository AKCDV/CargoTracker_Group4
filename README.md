# 🌡️ Group4 IoT: Real-Time Humidity Monitoring for Cargo Trucks 🚛

## Project Overview 📋
This project ensures the safe transport of sensitive goods by developing an IoT-based application that **monitors and controls humidity** inside cargo trucks. It sends **instant alerts** to drivers if conditions exceed set limits and can **automatically adjust** via HVAC systems to keep the cargo safe. 📊 **Historical data** is logged for compliance and traceability, while **predictive analytics** help avoid future problems. 🌐 **Cloud integration** allows fleet managers to oversee multiple trucks from anywhere.

## Features ✨

- **Real-Time Humidity Monitoring** 📡: Continuous tracking of humidity levels inside the cargo area using IoT sensors.
  
- **Customizable Humidity Thresholds** ⚙️: Set specific ranges based on the type of cargo being transported.

- **Driver Alerts** 📱: Instant notifications (via SMS, email, or mobile app) if humidity exceeds the safe range.

- **Automated Humidity Control** 🛠️: Integration with HVAC systems to automatically adjust and maintain ideal humidity levels.

- **Data Logging & Reporting** 🗄️: Store historical data for compliance and reporting, ensuring traceability.

- **Predictive Analytics** 🔮: Detect patterns and predict potential issues before they occur using machine learning.

- **Cloud Integration** ☁️: Centralized fleet monitoring for logistics managers, enabling remote access to data from multiple trucks.

## User Stories 🧑‍💻

- **As a driver**, I want to receive real-time alerts on my mobile device when humidity levels exceed safe limits, so I can take immediate action to protect the cargo. 🚨
  
- **As a fleet manager**, I want to monitor the humidity levels of all trucks remotely from a centralized dashboard, so I can ensure product safety across the fleet. 📊

- **As a logistics coordinator**, I want to set specific humidity thresholds for different types of cargo, so the system can maintain optimal conditions. 📦

- **As a truck owner**, I want to view historical humidity data for each trip, so I can verify that goods were kept in proper conditions and provide proof to clients. 📝

- **As a maintenance technician**, I want the system to notify me of recurring humidity issues, so I can perform preventive maintenance on the truck's climate control systems. 🔧
